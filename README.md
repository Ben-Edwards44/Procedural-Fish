# Procedural-Fish

> Procedurally animated fish

*The red fish follows your cursor*

## How it works :wrench:

- The fish are procedurally animated using the technique outlined in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlfh_rv6khY) video
- A boid simulation is used to control the behaviour of all the non-player fish, which is described [here](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/)

I feel like a game could be made from this... too bad I'm not really a gamedev :confused:
